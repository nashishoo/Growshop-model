        "core_values": [
            "Visual Excellence: The UI must WOW the user immediately. Use Glassmorphism, Neon Green accents, and fluid Micro-animations. Boring designs are strictly forbidden.",
            "Operational Simplicity: The Admin Panel must be intuitively usable by non-technical staff. Automation is key (emails, stock updates).",
            "Data Integrity: User data is sacred. Never expose private info. Payments and Orders must be transactional and atomic.",
            "Community First: The platform is a hub. Features like 'Club 420' (membership) are as important as the checkout."
